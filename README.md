# semicola
A chatbot using LUIS natural language processor hosted by Microsoft Azure. Built by my team (Team Missing Semicolon) during Siemens Innovation Days hackathon June 2018. We won 2nd place!

I was hoping to find more of the code that made it work but I didn't save the C# code to my machine before the hackathon ended and our Azure data was purged :( but here's an example of something for which LUIS can be used!
